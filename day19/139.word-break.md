Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
Example 2:

Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
Example 3:

Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```
```python
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        dp = [True] + [False] * len(s)
        for i in range(1,len(s)+1):
            for word in wordDict:
                j = i - len(word)
                if j>=0 and dp[j] and word == s[j:i]:
                    dp[i] = True
                    break
        return dp[-1]
