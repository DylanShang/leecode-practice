Given an integer n, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to n.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

Example 1:
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.

Example 2:
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0]
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            j = 1
            min_value = inf
            while j**2 <= i:
                min_value = min(min_value,dp[i-j**2]+1)
                j += 1
            dp.append(min_value)
        return dp[-1]
