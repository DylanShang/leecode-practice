```
Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        max_length = 0
        stack = []
        for i in range(n):
            while s[i] in stack:
                stack.pop(0)
            stack.append(s[i])
            max_length = max(max_length,len(stack))
        return max_length
```
