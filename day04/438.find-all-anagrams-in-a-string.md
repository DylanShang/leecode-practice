```
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's 
anagrams
 in s. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.

    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
    # 1) sliding window
        result = []
        n = len(s)
        m = len(p)
        if m>n: return []

        s_array = [0]*26
        p_array = [0]*26

        for i in range(m):
            p_array[ord(p[i])-ord('a')] += 1
            s_array[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] += 1
                
            
        for i in range(n-m+1):
            if p_array == s_array:
                result.append(i)
            s_array[ord(s[i])-ord('a')] -= 1
            if i+m<n:
                s_array[ord(s[i+m])-ord('a')] += 1
        return result
