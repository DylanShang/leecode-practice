The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: [["Q"]]
```

    def solveNQueens(self, n: int) -> List[List[str]]:
        result = []

                return
            for new_x in range(n):
                if new_x in path:
                    continue
                new_y = len(path)

                for old_y,old_x in enumerate(path):

                        flag = False
                if not flag: continue
                dfs(path + [new_x])
        dfs([])
        new_result = []
        for r in result:

            for num in r:
                temp = ["."]*n
                temp[num] = "Q"
                r_list.append("".join(temp))
            new_result.append(r_list)
            

        return new_result
