```
Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        p = 1
        p2 = 1
        first = True
        for x in nums:
            p *= x
            if x == 0 and first:
                first = False
            else:
                p2 *=x
        ans = []
        for x in nums:
            if x == 0:
                ans.append(p2)
            else:
                ans.append(int(p/x))
        return ans
