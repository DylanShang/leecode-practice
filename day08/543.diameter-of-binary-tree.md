Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
Example 2:

Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        max_d = 0
        def get_height(root):
            nonlocal max_d
            if root == None:return 0
            left_depth = get_height(root.left)
            right_depth = get_height(root.right)
            diameter = left_depth + right_depth
            max_d = max(max_d,diameter)
            return max(left_depth,right_depth)+1
        
        get_height(root)
        return max_d
