Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        visited = set()
        result = 0
        row_length = len(grid)
        co_length = len(grid[0])

        for r,row in enumerate(grid):
            for c,item in enumerate(row):
                if item =="0" or (r,c) in visited:
                    continue
                result += 1
                s = [(r,c)]
                while s:
                    def isValid(r,c):
                        if r<0 or r>= row_length or c<0 or c>=co_length:return False   
                        if (r,c) in visited or grid[r][c] == "0": return False
                        return True
                    x = s.pop()
                    visited.add(x)

                    if isValid(x[0]+1,x[1]):s.append((x[0]+1,x[1]))
                    if isValid(x[0],x[1]+1):s.append((x[0],x[1]+1))
                    if isValid(x[0]-1,x[1]):s.append((x[0]-1,x[1]))
                    if isValid(x[0],x[1]-1):s.append((x[0],x[1]-1))

        return result
