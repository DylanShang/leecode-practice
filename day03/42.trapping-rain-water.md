Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        prefix = height[0]
        postfix = height[n-1]
        i = 0
        j = n-1
        ans = 0

        while(i<j):
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                prefix = max(prefix,height[i])
                ans += prefix - height[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                postfix = max(postfix,height[j])
                ans += postfix - height[j]
                j-= 1
        return ans
```
