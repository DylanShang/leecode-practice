Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left 
subtree
 of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def dfs(root,left_b,right_b):
            if root == None: return True
            return left_b < root.val < right_b and dfs(root.left,left_b,root.val) and dfs(root.right,root.val,right_b)
        return dfs(root,-inf,inf)
